        <p>R is a programming language and software environment commonly used for statistical computing and graphics. It was created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland, New Zealand, in the early 1990s. R provides a wide range of statistical and graphical techniques, making it a popular choice among statisticians, data scientists, and researchers.</p>
        <p>One of the main strengths of R is its extensive collection of packages. R has a vibrant ecosystem with thousands of user-contributed packages available through the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) and other repositories. These packages extend the functionality of R by providing specialized tools for specific domains such as machine learning, data visualization, data manipulation, and more.</p>
        <p>R is known for its flexibility and expressiveness in handling and analyzing data. It offers a rich set of built-in data structures and functions for data manipulation, statistical modeling, hypothesis testing, and data visualization. R also has a command-line interface, which allows users to interactively enter commands and see immediate results. Additionally, there are integrated development environments (IDEs) such as RStudio that provide a user-friendly interface for working with R.</p>
        <p>Due to its open-source nature, R has a strong community of users who actively contribute to its development and share their knowledge through online resources, forums, and conferences. R is widely used in various fields, including academia, industry, finance, healthcare, and social sciences, for analyzing and interpreting data.</p>

        <header>What you should already know</header>
        <p>Before using the R language, it is beneficial to have some foundational knowledge in the following areas:</p>
        <li>Programming Concepts: Familiarity with basic programming concepts such as variables, data types, loops, conditional statements, and functions is helpful when working with R. Understanding how to write and structure code will make it easier to work with R's syntax.</li>
        <li>Statistics and Data Analysis: Since R is widely used for statistical computing, having a basic understanding of statistics and data analysis concepts is beneficial. This includes knowledge of descriptive statistics, probability, hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and data visualization.</li>
        <li>Data Manipulation: R provides powerful tools for data manipulation, so having knowledge of data cleaning, filtering, merging, and reshaping techniques is important. Familiarity with concepts like data frames, indexing, and subsetting will be helpful for working with datasets in R.</li>
        <li>Command-Line Interfaces: R primarily uses a command-line interface, so being comfortable with working in a terminal or command prompt environment will be useful. Understanding how to navigate directories, execute commands, and interpret command-line output will make it easier to interact with R.</li>
        <li>Statistical Programming Concepts: R is designed for statistical programming, so having a basic understanding of concepts like statistical models, hypothesis testing, and interpreting results will be valuable. Knowledge of common statistical tests and procedures will enable you to analyze data effectively.</li>

      <section class="main-section" id="Hello_world">
        <header>Hello world</header>
        <p>To print "Hello, world!" in R, you can use the print() function or simply write the text within quotes and run it in the R console. Here are two ways to achieve this:</p>
        <li>Using the print() function:</li>
        <code>print(Hello, world!)</code>
        <li>Running the text directly:</li>
        <code>Hello, world!</code>
        <p>Both approaches will produce the output "Hello, world!" in the R console.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Declaring_variables">
        <header>Declaring variables</header>
        <p>In R and RStudio, you can declare variables using the assignment operator <- or the equals sign =. Here's how you can declare variables in R and RStudio:</p>
        <li>Using the assignment operator</li>
        <code>variable_name <- value </code>
        <li>Using the equals sign</li>
        <code>variable_name = value</code>
        <h4>Here's an example to declare variables in R:</h4>
        <li>Using the assignment operator</li>
        <code>x <- 10</code>
        <code>y <- "Hello, World!"</code>
        <li>Using the equals sign</li>
        <code>z = TRUE</code>
        <p>In the example above, x is assigned the value 10, y is assigned the string "Hello, World!", and z is assigned the logical value TRUE.</p><p>You can then use these variables in your R code for computations, data manipulation, and analysis.</p>
